# single-project example

HUJ
This is a simple example on how a single project could look like and how the gradle-release plugin is configured.

## Usage

Fork the repository and checkout locally.

Then you can test executing the release by

```
$ cd single-project
$ ./gradlew release
```

On windows you would do

```
$ cd single-project
$ gradlew.bat release
```

## Contributing

If you have an idea which feature of the gradle-release plugin we could show here,
you are welcome to submit a pull request.
